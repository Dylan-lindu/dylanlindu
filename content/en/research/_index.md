The research group mainly focuses on scientific issues such as imaging markers and mechanism analysis of brain diseases and brain development. From the aspects of genome, transcriptome, multimodal brain imaging, phenotype, etc., to carry out cross-study of information science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and clinical medicine. The main research directions include:

(1) Extraction method of individualized brain structure and function indexes based on multimodal imaging technology, as well as fusion analysis method and modeling research with multi-omics data;

(2) Using imaging genomics and other methods to study objective biological markers and precise diagnosis and treatment models of major mental illnesses;

(3) Based on multi-level information to explore the relationship  of normal brain developmental trajectories model with development-related brain diseases .
