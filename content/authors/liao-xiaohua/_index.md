Neuroscience translation of multi-modal data: By combing genome, transcriptome, multi-modal neuroimaging and other data, we attempt to study the heritability of brain networks, the connection between brain networks and genetic variations, to find key genes modulating hub brain regions and important brain connectivity, and finally to reveal the underlying genetic and neural mechanisms of the individual differences in human neurodevelopment, behaviors or brain disorders and to construct dynamic prediction models of individual performance. Our lab has published over 70 research papers in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature Medicine, Journal of Neuroscience, Schizophrenia Bulletin, Neuropsychopharmacology, NeuroImage etc.
